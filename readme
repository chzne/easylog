No

4.can you show me how to use it in my project
all the things you need to do is just like following:
1.
@EnableEasylogAspect
public class HelloSpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> map = PatternLayout.defaultConverterMap;
        SpringApplication.run(HelloSpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }

}

2 you can use @Logging annotation to giving a description for your method .
the description  will appears in your log file to help you distinguish the invocation of a method .

@Logging(value = "the description for method", include = {Request.CLIENT, Request.HEADER})
@RequestMapping(value = "/helloWord", method = {RequestMethod.POST})
public Object helloWord(@RequestParam("userId") String userId, @RequestParam("name") String name, HttpServletRequest request)
